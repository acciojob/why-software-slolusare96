	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>
		There are many things behind why I want to become a software developer.
		First and foremost is the technology enthusiasm I have. In my previous job
		I was not having my brain simulated or tinkled with the technologies.
		But when I decided to become a software developer there is a urge from inside that I 
		can do something in this field.
		Second thing is the money that this field can offer.
		Considering the above reasons I have decided to become a software devloper.
